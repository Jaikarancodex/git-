# Git & GitHub
Git is a distributed version control system that records every change made to files, allowing developers to revert to previous versions, experiment with new features in separate branches, and merge updates safely. GitHub is an online platform that hosts Git repositories, enabling collaboration with other developers, remote access to code, and integration with CI/CD workflows for efficient project management.
